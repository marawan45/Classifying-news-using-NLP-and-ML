The AGâ€™s News Topic Classification task involves classifying news articles into one of four major categories using a preprocessed subset of the AG corpus.
The goal is to use natural language processing and machine learning techniques to accurately categorize each article based on its title and description.
This dataset and task are commonly used as a benchmark for text classification, especially for deep learning models.
